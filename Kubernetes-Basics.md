### **Container Management/Orchestration Tool:**
Tools like **Kubernetes**, **Docker Swarm**, or **AWS ECS** help automate the deployment, scaling, management, and operation of containerized applications. Orchestration ensures that containers are efficiently scheduled and run in a coordinated manner across multiple servers.

### **Deployment:**
Deployment refers to the process of releasing applications to the desired environment. In Kubernetes, deployments manage **Pods** (container instances) and ensure they run as intended. It includes updating apps, scaling, and rolling back versions when necessary.
