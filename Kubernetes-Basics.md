### **Container Management/Orchestration Tool:**
Tools like **Kubernetes**, **Docker Swarm**, or **AWS ECS** help automate the deployment, scaling, management, and operation of containerized applications. Orchestration ensures that containers are efficiently scheduled and run in a coordinated manner across multiple servers.

### **Deployment:**
Deployment refers to the process of releasing applications to the desired environment. In Kubernetes, deployments manage **Pods** (container instances) and ensure they run as intended. It includes updating apps, scaling, and rolling back versions when necessary.

### **Scheduling:**
Scheduling is the process of assigning containers to run on available nodes (servers). Kubernetes uses a scheduler to determine which node is best suited for a container based on factors like resource availability (CPU, memory).

### **Scaling:**
Scaling involves increasing or decreasing the number of containers running your application. **Horizontal scaling** adds more container instances, while **vertical scaling** increases the resources allocated to existing containers. Kubernetes handles scaling automatically based on resource utilization or manually.

### **Load Balancing:**
Load balancing distributes network traffic evenly across multiple containers, ensuring no single container gets overwhelmed. Kubernetes **Services** handle load balancing by routing requests to the appropriate Pods.

### **Batch Execution:**
Batch execution refers to running jobs or tasks in a sequence. In Kubernetes, **Jobs** create and manage Pods that perform batch processing tasks. Once the tasks are completed, the Pods terminate.

### **Rollbacks:**
A rollback is the process of reverting to a previous version of an application in case of issues during or after deployment. Kubernetes facilitates easy rollbacks by maintaining deployment history.

### **Monitoring:**
Monitoring involves tracking the health and performance of containers, applications, and infrastructure. In Kubernetes, tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, or built-in logs/metrics are used to monitor cluster performance, resource usage, and detect issues.

### **Kubernetes = Orchestration:**
Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that automates container management tasks such as deployment, scaling, networking, and monitoring. It is a leading orchestration tool for containerized applications.
