# üìò Scenario 3: Node Not Rejoining After Reboot

**Category**: Cluster Management  
**Environment**: Kubernetes v1.21, Self-managed cluster, Static nodes  

---

## Scenario Summary  
A rebooted node failed to rejoin the cluster due to a kubelet identity mismatch caused by hostname changes.

---

## What Happened  
- After a **kernel upgrade and reboot**, a node disappeared from `kubectl get nodes`  
- **Kubelet failed to register** with the control plane  
- Investigation revealed a **hostname mismatch** between the node's current state and its cluster registration  

---

## Diagnosis Steps  
1. **Checked system logs**:  
   ```sh
   journalctl -u kubelet --no-pager | grep -i "registration"
   ```
2. **Verified kubelet configuration**:  
   - Found `--hostname-override` didn't match the originally registered node name 
3. **Compared cluster state**:  
   ```sh
   kubectl get nodes -o wide  # Showed old hostname vs. current DHCP-assigned hostname
   ```
4. **Identified root issue**:  
   - Node's **hostname changed after reboot** (DHCP lease renewal or cloud-init behavior)  

---

## Root Cause  
**Identity mismatch**:  
- Kubelet attempted to register with a **new hostname**  
- Control plane still expected the **original node identity**  
- Certificate SANs/Node authorization rejected the "new" node  

---

## Fix/Workaround  
1. **Corrected hostname override**:  
   ```sh
   # Update kubelet config (e.g., /etc/default/kubelet)
   KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS="--hostname-override=<original-node-name>"
   systemctl restart kubelet
   ```
2. **Cleaned stale node entry** (if needed):  
   ```sh
   kubectl delete node <old-node-name>
   ```

## Lessons Learned  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Hostname consistency is critical** for node identity in Kubernetes.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **DHCP + Kubernetes requires careful planning** to avoid identity drift.  

---

## How to Avoid  
‚úÖ **Use static hostnames/IPs** for nodes:  
   ```sh
   hostnamectl set-hostname <persistent-name>
   ```
‚úÖ **Standardize node provisioning** with:  
   - Immutable cloud-init configurations  
   - Kubeadm `--node-name` flag (if applicable) 
‚úÖ **Monitor node heartbeats**:  
   ```sh
   kubectl get nodes -w
   ```
‚úÖ **Implement automated detection** for:  
   - Nodes stuck in `NotReady`  
   - Hostname mismatches in kubelet logs  

---

### Key Improvements:
1. **Added actionable commands** with proper syntax highlighting
2. **Structured troubleshooting flow** from symptoms to resolution
3. **Included prevention automation** (monitoring commands)
4. **Emphasized key takeaways** with icons (‚ö†Ô∏è, ‚úÖ)
5. **Added context** about certificate SANs/authorization impact
6. **Standardized formatting** with clear section breaks (`---`)
