# ðŸ“˜ Scenario 29: kube-scheduler Crash Due to Invalid Leader Election Config

**Category**: Control Plane Stability  
**Environment**: Kubernetes 1.24, Custom Scheduler Deployment  
**Impact**: Complete scheduling halt for 1.5 hours  

---

## Scenario Summary  
A misconfigured leader election namespace caused the `kube-scheduler` to crash on startup, freezing all new pod scheduling across the cluster.

---

## What Happened  
- **Helm customization error**:  
  - Values override set `leaderElection.namespace: kube-scheduler` (non-existent)  
  - Deployed via CI/CD pipeline without validation  
- **Immediate symptoms**:  
  - Scheduler pods crashed with `panic: failed to create leader election record`  
  - `kubectl get events` showed `FailedScheduling` for 300+ pods  
- **Configuration audit**:  
  - Leader election locks require namespace existence  
  - Default RBAC lacked namespace creation permissions
