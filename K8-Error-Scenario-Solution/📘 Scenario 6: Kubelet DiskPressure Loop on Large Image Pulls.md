# ðŸ“˜ Scenario 6: Kubelet DiskPressure Loop on Large Image Pulls

**Category**: Node Resource Management  
**Environment**: Kubernetes v1.22, EKS  

## Scenario Summary  
Nodes entered a destructive eviction loop due to disk exhaustion from pulling oversized container images, triggering continuous `DiskPressure` conditions.

---

## What Happened  
- A **multi-layered container image (5GB+)** was deployed cluster-wide  
- Nodes exhibited:  
  - Frequent pod evictions (`Evicted: DiskPressure`)  
  - Cascading failures as evicted pods automatically rescheduled  
  - **CPU throttling** from kubelet's constant garbage collection  
- Cluster autoscaler added nodes but they quickly became unstable
