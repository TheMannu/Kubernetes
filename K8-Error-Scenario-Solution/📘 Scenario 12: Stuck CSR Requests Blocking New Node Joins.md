# ðŸ“˜ Scenario 12: Stuck CSR Requests Blocking New Node Joins

**Category**: Cluster Authentication  
**Environment**: Kubernetes v1.20, kubeadm cluster  
**Impact**: Node provisioning freeze, scaling operations failed  

---

## Scenario Summary  
A disabled CSR approval controller caused a backlog of 500+ unapproved certificate signing requests, preventing new nodes from joining the cluster and existing nodes from renewing certificates.  

---

## What Happened  
- **Security patch misstep**:  
  - `--cluster-signing-cert-file` flag was removed during CIS hardening  
  - CSR approval controller silently stopped processing requests  
- **Symptoms emerged**:  
  - New nodes stuck at `[kubelet] Waiting for server to sign certificate`  
  - Existing nodes began failing health checks as certificates expired  
  - `kubectl get nodes` showed `NotReady` for recently added nodes  
- **Certificate chain reaction**:  
  - Kubelet client certs (default 1y expiry) started expiring en masse  
  - Cluster-autoscaler couldn't provision worker nodes
