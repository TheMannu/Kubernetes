# 📘 Scenario 5: Misconfigured Taints Blocking Pod Scheduling

**Category**: Cluster Management  
**Environment**: Kubernetes v1.26, Multi-tenant cluster  

---

## Scenario Summary  
Critical workloads failed to schedule after blanket `NoSchedule` taints were applied without corresponding workload tolerations, causing cluster-wide scheduling issues.

---

## What Happened  
- A team added `NoSchedule` taints to **all worker nodes** to isolate their application  
- **Existing workloads** lacked matching tolerations  
- Cluster monitoring showed:  
  - Sudden spike in `Pending` pods  
  - Critical system pods (CNI, monitoring) failing to schedule  
- Applications began failing SLA as pods couldn't be rescheduled
